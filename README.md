# Spot
Spoiler blocker for Game of Thrones and your other favourite movies on Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Google News feeds.
Tired of spoilers every-time your favourite movie is released. Spot helps you with not the spoilers but also snoozing topics like Politics and adult content.

Works across all your favourite sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and Instagram, etc. 
It works by finding the relevant div containing the text and masking it with an empty div.
